## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user submits a long URL via the frontend.  
2. The backend generates a **unique 6-character slug** using NanoID.  
3. The original URL and slug are stored in **PostgreSQL**.  
4. When `/slug` is visited, the backend:
   - Finds the original URL  
   - Increments the click count  
   - Redirects the user
